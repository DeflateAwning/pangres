This folder contains the same information as in the GitHub [wiki](https://github.com/ThibTrip/pangres/wiki).

Some parts of the wiki are generated. Indeed, all the files in the directory `./templates` are
templates with placeholders.

The placeholders follow the syntax defined in the library [npdoc_to_md](https://github.com/ThibTrip/npdoc_to_md/).

See also the `Usage` section of the `README.md` file at the root of the repository.
